<h1>Ken(Wen Zuojun) Resume</h1>
<h2>This is Ken's resume</h2>
<p>My three favorite courses are database design, web page making and physical education. Because the two courses of database design and web page making can provide you with job hunting skills, while physical education can make your body stronger. Besides, I also prefer physical education. I can enjoy sports in PE class.</p>
<p>I think my strength is good at analysis and high observation and concentration. This gives me an advantage in completing some areas that require a long time to maintain my attention. But my disadvantage is that it is easy to transfer the heat, which makes me unable to maintain enthusiasm for a long time when doing anything. </p>
<p>Therefore, based on my strengths and weaknesses, when I complete the task, I usually develop my strengths and avoid my weaknesses, give priority to the goals that take a short time and the goals that take a long time. I usually put them at the end and finish them after completing a small part. I will choose to take a break and listen to music for a while to divert my attention.</p>
